<h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
<a href="#supportmymachine"/><h3>Why doesn't SleepyHead support [insert obscure/new device] yet?</h3>
<p>Plenty of reasons.. Pick your favourite:</p>
<list>
<li>&#8226; Because the 5 people who own one can't supply enough data to see all possible event codes?</li>
<li>&#8226; Because it doesn't feature a flow waveform and would be boring?</li>
<li>&#8226; Because one unpaid developer can only hack, create, and maintain so many importers before they go insane?</li>
<li>&#8226; Because to get it right takes a really, really big number of developer man-hours that would be better spent on other parts of the program?</li>
<li>&#8226; Because the build quality perhaps is garbage and nobody should own one?</li>
<li>&#8226; Because nobody else is interested in helping hack the formats?</li>
<li>&#8226; Because I prefer hands on and rarely get to play with/hack on the hardware directly?</li>
</list>
<a href="#compliance"/><h3>Why doesn't SleepyHead let me generate <i>compliance</i> reports?</h3>
<p>Mainly, to avoid attracting the lawsuits that would inevitably come from offering this capability. Here are the primary reasons why I'm dead against it:</p>
<list>
<li>&#8226; It's far too easy to change the source code to fake compliance reports.</li>
<li>&#8226; Do you like the idea of sharing the road with truck drivers with an untreated sleep disorder who faked compliance data?</li>
<li>&#8226; Data Formats of CPAP machines in SleepyHead had to be hacked because manufacturers don't release documentation, and accuracy can't be guaranteed.</li>
<li>&#8226; To do it would require closing the sourcecode and establishing a relationship with manufacturers who have proven they care very little about data access rights.</li>
</list>
<p>This stuff is also the reason I never bothered hacking CPAP data Checksums... If they were public knowledge, people could alter SD data card content, which would not be cool.</p>
